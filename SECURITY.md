## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to let us know as soon as possible. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem. Please follow these steps to report a vulnerability:

1. **Do Not Publicly Disclose the Vulnerability**: Publicly disclosing a vulnerability can put the entire community at risk. Instead, please send your report privately to our security team.

2. **Provide Detailed Information**: In your report, please provide as much information as possible about the vulnerability. This can include:
   - The conditions that must be met to exploit the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - Any possible mitigations for the vulnerability.

3. **Contact Us**: Send your report to [duongcoilc2004@gmail.com](mailto:duongcoilc2004@gmail.com). We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours, and provide a more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report.

After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement. We may also ask for additional information or guidance.

Please report security vulnerabilities in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a vulnerability report, the following actions are taken:

1. **Confirmation**: Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
2. **Audit**: Conduct an audit to find any potential similar problems.
3. **Patch**: Develop a fix in a private repository.
4. **Release**: Make a public release containing the fix.
5. **Announcement**: After the release, announce the vulnerability to the public including a description, possible impacts, and mitigation strategies.
