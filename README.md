# React Base Version: A Comprehensive Development Platform

Welcome to my React Base Version, a premier development platform meticulously designed to cater to both novice and
seasoned.

For **Frontend developers**. My platform stands out for its clarity and high interactivity, incorporating with *
*`Next.js` - the renowned framework for React applications**.

---

## Platform Overview

Dive into my **React Base Version**, a state-of-the-art development platform engineered to streamline the web
application development journey. Leveraging the prowess of **Vite**, my platform promises an enhanced development
experience characterized by swift rebuilds and hot module replacement. Tailored for seamless integration with Next.js,
my platform underscores my dedication to server-side rendering, static site generation, and the forefront of web
development practices.

Featuring **i18n (internationalization)** and **markdown-it**, my platform emphasizes the creation of globally
accessible and content-rich applications. With **ESLint** and **Prettier** at the helm, i'm ensure your codebase remains
pristine, consistent, and aligned with industry best practices, significantly reducing bugs.

Our project's infrastructure is bolstered by **Jenkins**, **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, and **GitLab CI/CD**, crafting
a robust CI/CD pipeline that facilitates automated testing, building, and deployment. This infrastructure is pivotal in
maintaining high code quality and fostering continuous integration and delivery.

The integration of Jest for testing enables comprehensive unit and integration tests, ensuring your application's
flawless operation. **Tailwind CSS's** inclusion for styling introduces a utility-first CSS framework that accelerates
the creation of custom designs directly within your HTML.

Moreover, my platform includes **middleware for authentication** testing, a vital element for securing your application
and protecting user data. It also boasts nested routers and a layout system akin to **Next.js (v14)**, providing a
structured approach to managing your application's pages and components.

Simplifying the management of environment variables through **`process.env`**, my project streamlines configuration
across different environments, making it an ideal starting point for developers aiming to craft modern, scalable web
applications. It combines a potent suite of tools and best practices to aid in the efficient development of high-quality
software.

## Getting Started

Kickstart your development journey with these steps:

### Environment Setup

1. **Create Environment Variables:**
    - Generate a `.env.local` file in the project's root directory.
    - Populate it with essential environment variables:
      ```
      NODE_ENV=production
 
      PORT=3000
      HOST_URL=http://localhost:3000
      SERVER_URL=# Your Server Url, e.g., http://localhost:8080
      ```
   This setup enables your development server to operate on port 3000 and interface with the backend service on port 8080.


2. **Launch the Development Server:**
    - Execute `npm run dev` to initiate the development server, offering real-time visibility into your modifications.

3. **Application Build:**
    - Employ `npm run build` to compile the application for deployment.

4. **Production Environment Execution:**
    - Post-build, `npm start` runs your application in the production setting.

## Project Architecture

Our base version is intuitively structured for easy navigation and initiation:

- **`src/`**: Hosts the core source code, including React components, pages, and logic.
- **`public/`**: Stores static assets like images, icons, and HTML files, accessible via URL.
- **`apis/`**: Manages API communication, organizing backend server requests.
- **`config/`**: Contains configuration files for setting environment variables and application settings.
- **`context/`**: Houses React Contexts for efficient state management and sharing across the application.
- **`helpers/`**: Includes utility functions and common logic for code reuse and cleanliness.
- **`hooks/`**: Dedicated to custom React hooks for separating and reusing state logic or dependencies.
- **`i18n/`**: Holds internationalization configuration files and resources, supporting multilingual applications.
- **`layout/`**: Features common layout components like Header and Footer, used across various pages.
- **`router/`**: Oversees application routing, linking routes with their respective components.
- **`types/`**: Defines TypeScript types, enhancing data type management and type safety.
